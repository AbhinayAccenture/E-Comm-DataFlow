**Project Title:** Mini E-Commerce Data Pipeline with Azure and Databricks  

---

## **Purpose**  
The purpose of this project is to build an end-to-end data pipeline using Azure and Databricks to process e-commerce data. This project simulates a real-world scenario where large volumes of customer and transaction data are ingested, processed, and visualized for business insights.  

---

## **Impact**  
- **Business Insight:** The processed data can provide insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.  
- **Real-Time Analytics:** The pipeline allows near real-time data processing to keep the data updated and actionable.  
- **Data Quality and Accuracy:** Proper ETL processing ensures clean, accurate, and structured data for reporting and analysis.  
- **Cost Optimization:** Using Azure resources efficiently to minimize cloud costs while handling high data volume.  

---

## **Architecture Overview**  
1. **Data Source:** Sample e-commerce dataset stored in Azure Blob Storage.  
2. **Data Processing:** Databricks for ETL processing.  
3. **Data Storage:** Processed data stored back into Blob Storage.  
4. **Data Visualization:** Power BI for creating business dashboards and reports.  
5. **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automating deployment and version control.    

---

## **Steps Involved**  

### **1. Data Ingestion**  
- Create an Azure Blob Storage account.  
- Upload sample e-commerce data files (CSV format) to Blob Storage.  

### **2. Data Processing in Databricks**  
- Create a Databricks cluster on Azure.  
- Connect Databricks to Blob Storage using a service principal or SAS token.  
- Create a Databricks notebook:  
   - Read data from Blob Storage.  
   - Clean and transform data (e.g., handling null values, type casting).  
   - Aggregate data for business insights.  
   - Write processed data back to Blob Storage.  

### **3. Data Visualization in Power BI**  
- Connect Power BI to Blob Storage.  
- Import processed data into Power BI.  
- Create visualizations (e.g., sales by category, customer behavior).  

### **4. CI/CD Setup**  
- Create a GitHub repository.  
- Add project files and data pipeline scripts.  
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD:  
   - On commit, trigger build and deployment.  
   - Deploy Databricks notebook and Power BI template automatically.  

### **5. Testing and Validation**  
- Validate the data accuracy and completeness.  
- Test data pipeline performance and scalability.

## **Additional Requirements**  
‚úÖ Service Principal for Databricks connection to Blob Storage.  
‚úÖ Contributor role for deploying CI/CD using GitHub Actions.  
‚úÖ Power BI workspace connection to Azure Blob Storage.  
‚úÖ Proper firewall and VNet configuration for secure connectivity.  

---

## **Challenges & Suggestions**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Permission Issues:** Ensure that Databricks and GitHub Actions have proper access to Blob Storage and Power BI.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Tuning:** Optimize Databricks cluster size based on data volume and complexity.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost Monitoring:** Use Azure cost analysis to monitor spending on Databricks and Power BI.  
üí° **Alternative:** If service principal setup is blocked, perform manual deployment and document the steps.  

---

## **Outcome**  
This project will simulate a real-world e-commerce data processing pipeline and provide meaningful business insights. The automated CI/CD setup will enable continuous improvement and deployment.  

---

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Add real-time streaming using Azure Event Hub and Kafka.  
- Integrate predictive analytics using Azure Machine Learning.  
- Automate cost optimization using Azure Advisor.
