*Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to build an end-to-end data pipeline using Azure Synapse, Databricks, and Power BI to process and analyze e-commerce data. This project simulates a real-world scenario where large volumes of customer and transaction data are ingested, processed, and visualized for business insights.



*Impact:

Business Insight: The processed data can provide insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

Real-Time Analytics: The pipeline allows near real-time data processing to keep the data updated and actionable.

Data Quality and Accuracy: Proper ETL processing ensures clean, accurate, and structured data for reporting and analysis.

Cost Optimization: Using Azure resources efficiently to minimize cloud costs while handling high data volume.



*Architecture Overview:

Data Source: Sample e-commerce dataset stored in Azure Blob Storage.

Data Ingestion: Synapse pipeline to load data into Synapse tables.

Data Processing: Databricks for ETL processing.

Data Storage: Processed data stored back into Synapse tables.

Data Visualization: Power BI connected to Synapse for creating business dashboards and reports.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automating build, test, and artifact creation (excluding deployment).



*Steps Involved:

1. Data Ingestion using Synapse
Create an Azure Synapse workspace.
Create a Synapse Pipeline to ingest sample e-commerce data (CSV format) from Blob Storage into Synapse tables.
Use a data flow activity for data mapping and transformation if required.

2. Data Processing in Databricks
Create a Databricks cluster on Azure.
Connect Databricks to Synapse using a linked service or managed identity.
Create a Databricks notebook:
Read data from Synapse tables.
Clean and transform data (e.g., handling null values, type casting).
Aggregate data for business insights.
Write processed data back into Synapse tables.

3. Data Visualization in Power BI
Connect Power BI to Synapse using DirectQuery or Import mode.
Import processed data from Synapse tables into Power BI.
Create visualizations (e.g., sales by category, customer behavior).

4. CI/CD Setup
Create a GitHub repository.
Add project files and data pipeline scripts.
Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
On commit, trigger build and lint checks.
Run unit tests for PySpark transformations.
Generate artifacts (processed data and scripts).
Skip deployment due to permission limits.

5. Testing and Validation
Validate the data accuracy and completeness.
Test data pipeline performance and scalability.



*Additional Requirements:

‚úÖ Service Principal for Synapse and Databricks connection.
‚úÖ Contributor role for deploying CI/CD using GitHub Actions.
‚úÖ Power BI workspace connection to Synapse.
‚úÖ Proper firewall and VNet configuration for secure connectivity.



*Challenges & Suggestions:

‚ö†Ô∏è Permission Issues: Ensure Synapse and GitHub Actions have proper access to Databricks and Power BI.
‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Tuning: Optimize Synapse and Databricks cluster size based on data volume and complexity.
‚ö†Ô∏è Cost Monitoring: Use Azure cost analysis to monitor spending on Synapse and Databricks.
üí° Alternative: If service principal setup is blocked, perform manual deployment and document the steps.



*Outcome:

This project will simulate a real-world e-commerce data processing pipeline and provide meaningful business insights. The automated CI/CD setup will enable continuous improvement and deployment.



*Future Enhancements:
Add real-time streaming using Azure Event Hub and Kafka.
Integrate predictive analytics using Azure Machine Learning.
Automate cost optimization using Azure Advisor.
