*Purpose:

The purpose of this setup is to create an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) account to store raw e-commerce data (Amazon sales data). ADLS Gen2 will act as the source for data ingestion into Azure Synapse and Databricks for further processing and reporting.



*Steps to Set Up Data Lake Storage:

1. Create Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2

Sign in to the Azure Portal.
Go to Storage Accounts ‚Üí + Create.
Configure the following settings:
Subscription: Select your subscription
Resource Group: Create a new or select an existing resource group
Storage Account Name: Use a unique name (e.g., ecommdatalake)
Region: Select the closest region
Performance: Standard
Replication: Locally-redundant storage (LRS)
Enable hierarchical namespace ‚Üí Enabled (important for ADLS Gen2)
Click Review + Create ‚Üí Create

2. Create a Container

In the newly created storage account, go to Containers ‚Üí + Container
Name it raw-data
Set Public access level to Private
Click Create

3. Upload Sample Data

Open the raw-data container
Click Upload
Select the Amazon sales data files (CSV format)
Click Upload

4. Set Permissions

Go to Access keys ‚Üí Copy the Connection string (for Databricks and Synapse)
Example ADLS Path:
https://<storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net/raw-data/<filename>.csv



*Challenges & Suggestions:
‚ö†Ô∏è Permission Issues: Ensure that Databricks and Synapse have proper access to the container.
‚ö†Ô∏è Data Overwrite: Set proper overwrite settings if re-uploading data.
üí° Alternative: Use a SAS token if direct access via service principal is blocked.



*Outcome:
‚úÖ Data Lake Storage is set up to store and ingest e-commerce data into Synapse and Databricks.
‚úÖ Data is ready for processing and analysis.
